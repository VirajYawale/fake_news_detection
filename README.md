# fake_news_detection
It is a Software Lab-2 Project


## Journey to work on this project:

<ul>
    <li>1.<b> Make the program for fake news detection which was using dataset</b> - problem with this was it was detecting the new only from the dataset, it was unable to detect the unseen news. (file is in directory named as <b>fake_news_using_dataset   </b>)</li><br>
    <li>2.<b> Make the program for fake news detection which was using API</b> - problem with that was unable to find the proper API which will give real-time news (tried file in directory <b>fake_news_using_API</b>)</li><br>
    <li>3.<b> Make the program for fake news detection which was using dataset</b> - here we use the dataset to train the model and identify its pattern on real and fake news named data preprocessing with give almost 99% accuracy to detect the real news but the use should to it the proper description (file name: <b>project1.ipynb</b>)</li>
</ul>

### The data set used is in the directory named dataset_used
### And my one of the learning was - how to extract the data from API and store it in csv & how to extract the real-time data from API
